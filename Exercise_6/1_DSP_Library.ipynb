    "## About the CMSIS-DSP library\n",
    "\n",
    "The CMSIS-DSP library contains a large number of new functions, structs and data types. Generally the new data types such as `flaot32_t` are simply an alias standard data types such as `float`, but to maintain good pratice we will use the `float32_t` data type. That way, the variable declarations will \"match\" the functions with suffic `_f32` in their function name.\n",
    "\n",
    "The functions themselves are created to process entire arrays of data rather than individual values, similar in spirit to the `numpy` library. However, since this is  `C` and not `Python`, the functions can't return entire arrays as output and instead rely on [*pointers*](https://www.w3schools.com/c/c_pointers.php) to where they should write the calculated output. Below is an example of using a simple copy-function for an array of 32-bit floating point numbers:\n",
    "\n",
    "> #### Code Example:\n",
    ">```C\n",
    ">#define ARR_SIZE 4 \n",
    ">float32_t input_array[ARR_SIZE] = {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0};\n",
    ">float32_t output_array[ARR_SIZE];\n",
    ">\n",
    ">arm_copy_f32(input_array, output_array, ARR_SIZE);\n",
    ">\n",
    ">```\n",
    ">\n",
    ">#### Explanation:\n",
    "> The function `arm_copy_f32` has return type `void`, meaning it does not return a value. Instead, it recieves a pointer to the array `output_array`, whose values will be changed by the execution of the function. In other words, once the function call is executed, the content of  `input_array` is copied to `output_array`. Since a pointer is merely a reference to \"where the array starts\" with no added information about e.g. length, we also need to pass an argument `ARR_SIZE` so that the function can know how long the arrays are.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Processing complex data\n",
    "\n",
    "Many of the functions in the CMSIS-DSP library use complex numbers as input/output. Complex data is stored in a normal array with length $2\\ \\times$ the number of complex values. Real and complex parts are then stored alternately as follows:\n",
