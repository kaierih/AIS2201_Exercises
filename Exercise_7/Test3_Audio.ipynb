    "Just like with the sinusoid test, we can use audio recordings of real-world sounds as a basis for testing the system performance on more complex waveforms, and add progressive levels of white noise for each iteration. \n",

    "In the \"Data\" folder you can find a number of audio files you can use as test input. Most of these files contain a short recording of a continuous musical note. If you wish to adjust the samping frequency of the sound files, take a look at the function [`resample`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.signal.resample.html) in the `scipy.signal` module.\n"

    "[Here](Figures/wavfileTest_LF.png) is an image showing a *suggestion* for what or test output may look like when using the audio in `A4_oboe.wav` as a signal. As we can see, the frequency detection system produces a stable but erroneous output when there is little noise, suggesting it has \"locked on\" to a harmonic rather than the fundamental frequency. It is also interesting to note that the noise will begin to cause the estimated frequency to fluctuate a lot earlier than in the case with the pure sinusoid, so while the average error remains more or less unchanged, the estimated frequency will vary significantly."
