    "# Part 2: ADC Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "In this task we will learn about how the built-in ADCs on a STM32 F446re Nucleo Board works, and how it is configured to exercise certain behaviours. There are three ADCs available to us, and all of them are [successive approximation register adcs (SAR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Successive-approximation_ADC). Sampling with a SAR ADC is controlled by a clock signal, and happens in two stages:\n",
    "1. The input voltage is fed to a capacitor, which can hold the charge while the A/D conversion occors. Once a certain number of clock cycles are completed, the input line is disconnected from the capacitor, leaving the current stored in  the capacitor with nowhere to go. The voltage over the capacitor will now remain constant.\n",
    "2. A clever digital circuit connected to the capacitor uses something akin to [binary search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search) to \"home in\" on the precise capacitor voltage. The circuit will be able to do 1 bisection step (i.e. generating 1 bit of the ADC output value) per clock cycle, meaning a 12 bit A/D conversion requires at minimum 12 clock cycles. Then comes some overhead for clearing registers between conversions etc.\n",

    "## Sampling frequency using countinuous successive approximation ADC in continuous mode\n",
    "\n",
    "For simple systems using analog input without strict requirements to high sampling speed it is usually sufficient to keep the ADC in \"single conversion mode\", where each A/D conversion is initiated by a function call (such as `analogRead()` on an arduino). However, it is also possible to configure the ADC to begin a new A/D conversion immediately after completing the previous one. In this case, the sampling frequency will be determined by a number of factors which will vary depending on the type of ADC. For a Successive Approximation ADC such as the one in a STM32 F446RE, these factors are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Peripheral Clock Signal**: A square wave clock signal generated by the processor, which controls the ADC (and a number of other components).\n",
    "* **ADC Clock Prescaler**: An integer factor which determines the clock speed of the ADC relative to peripheral clock.\n",
    "    * Example: If the peripheral clock is $84 \\text{MHz}$, and the ADC clock prescaler is $8$, the ADC clock signal will be $\\frac{84\\text{ MHz}}{8} = 10.5 \\text{MHz}$\n",
    "* **Conversion time:** Determined by the ADC resolution. For the STM32 F446RE a 12-bit conversion (full resolution) requires $15$ clock cycles\n",
    "* **Sample time:** Number of ADC clock cycles to wait while charging up the capacitor which will \"hold\" the sampled value once conversion begins.\n",
    "    * Example: If the sample time is $3$ clock cycles, and the conversion time is $15$ clock cycles, then the total number of clock cycles per sample converted is $T = 3 + 15 = 18$.\n",

    "\n",
    "A microprocessor usually configures a peripheral such as an ADC by making adjustments to one or more [*registers*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Processor_register). From a coder's perspective, a register is a specific part of the MCU's memory whose value is passed directly to the peripheral, and can be accessed using a certain global variable name which can be found in the MCU's reference manual. While many chip producers also provide software libraries which offer ways of configuring a peripheral without modifying a register directly, it is always useful to have a some knowledge of what's going on \"under the hood\" for those situations when the only option left is to hit the registers directly.\n",

    "On a STM32, registers are singular 32-bit integer values, where each bit has a specific purpose. To adjust these, it is necessary to make use of [*bitwise operators*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operations_in_C). \n",
