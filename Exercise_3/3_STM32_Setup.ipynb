    "This task provides a step-by-step guide to configure an STM32-F446RE nucleo board to feed through voltage levels sampled with an ADC to the MCU's the built-in DAC. While there are numerous ways this may be accomplished, the suggested solution in this guide makes use of an ADC in continuous mode and uses interrupt requests to process voltagelevels once they've been converted to a digital representation. Happily, the CubeIDE provieds a graphical tool for generating all the various configuration settings for ADCs and similar, so there is no need to modify the registers manually.\n",
