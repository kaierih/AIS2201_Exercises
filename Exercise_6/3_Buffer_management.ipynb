    "In this task section we will write the code to manage the stream of samples from the ADC, as well as the interrupt routines which are triggered by the ADC. The goal is to implement the \"buffer switching\" stage in [this animation](Figures/DualBufferAnim.gif) which leads up to the RFFT calculation.\n",

    "The very first thing we need to do is define a window length for the RFFT. In this assignment we will be using window size $N=1024$, so use this as a basis for answering the theory questions later. You are welcome to experiment with other window sizes later, but there are two details wich will need to be taken into account: the window size must be a power of 2 due to how the FFT algorithm works, and the available clock speed/memory on the microprocesser sets an upper limit to possible window sizes.<br><br>\n",
